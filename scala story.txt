Scala is cool. Writing Android application with Scala is also a cool idea. Because Android exposes Java API, we need some wrapper and utility library to leverage full power of Scala. android-scala-common is an initial attempt to provide this.

For example, the code block shown below:
val button = new Button(context)
button.setText("send")
button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
  def onClick(v: View) {
    sendMessage()
  }
})
layout.addView(button)

is reduced to:
layout.addView(newButton("send", sendMessage()))


Searching web or stackoverflow with "android scala", there are many individual attempts to polish verbose Android API with Scala. Android-scala-common integrates these ideas and provides an out-of-the-box solution. In this library, there are many gems to help write your Android software elegently. Fork the code on github and contribute us:

Android programming is a promising area of Scala can shining its merits. Individual attempts on improving Android APIs should be integrated and packaged into out-of-the-box solutions. I think that this kind of collaboration is important, so I submitted the story.
